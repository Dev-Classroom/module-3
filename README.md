## Project Overview

For this first large-scale project, you'll be working with a small group of students as a design team. You've worked with small groups before, but this is the most intsensive amount of work you've done to date.

With your team, you'll be responsible for coming up with an idea for a useful/needed app at your school. There are a *ton* of deliverables for this project, but you'll have plenty of team members to collaborate and share the load with. You should be famililar with all the deliverables below, but this *will* be your first time working with potential users and interviewing them. Good thing those soft skills are relevant!

At the end of this project, you'll pitch your idea to potential investors (either via your recorded pitch deck, or in person if conditions allow). Hopefull you'll have built out a convincing prototype and encouraged some confidence from those VCs with the $$$$.
